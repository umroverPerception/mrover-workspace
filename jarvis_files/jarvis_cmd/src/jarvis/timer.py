''' 
GOAL: 
- create a Python script that can be run by jarvis for timing our code

IDEA: 
- script builds and executes perception on the command line 
- write runtime for each function to file 
- after running, find median, mean, and std. dev execution time of each function + 
as well as these statistics for the fps of the code. 

RESULT: 
- new function to jarvis called "test". 
- be able to run ./jarvis test jetson/percep timing, which will execute the python script 
and should then seamlessly provide timing output for our code.
