    [nav] Refactor navigation simulator
    
    resolves #308
    
    Refactor navigation simulator to use Vue and TypeScript.
    This refactor is indented to make the simulator easier to maintain,
    make it easier to add new features, and move towards using
    technologies that are more commonly used in industry.
    
    We are keeping around the old version of the simulator
    temporarily in case the refactored version has any major
    problems. This should be deleted when the correctness of the
    refactored version is confirmed.

    [nav] Implement GateShimmy state
    
    This implementation assumes that we initially see both posts
    of the gate from the center point and that we don't lose the
    posts while in this state. This assumption will likely need
    to be revisited in the future.

    [nav-sim] Implement notifying when rover crashes into gate.
    
    The gates are still note drawn completely to scale and it is possible
    to appear to be driving through a gate post when you actually are not.
    This, along with a more fleshed out logic for crashes will come in a
    later commit but this functionality was needed now for testing even if the
    UI was not perfect.

    [IK] Created orientation IK; created IK testing suite; created torque calculation; updated to new arm model; refined collision avoidance model
    
    Ready to test orientation IK
    
    simulation working, computation not
    
    updated algorithm, still not functioning properly
    
    changed way we calculate rotation matrix
    
    we updated the calculation
    
    need to work on proof of concept
    
    my amazing message
    
    orientation IK POC good enough, not great tolerance.
    
    removed one of the fk calculations
    
    need changes from poc
    
    again
    
    sids gonna look at a way to move the ef
    
    added fantom joint f
    
    Made changes to kinematics tester
    
    Made changes to kinematics tester
    
    Created quadratic relationship between radius and phi
    
    Update kinematics_tester.py
    
    Updated kinematics_tester
    
    created class
    
    kinematics tester working. We fail a lot of the time
    
    need more time to test
    
    We realize the issue is with the testing suite
    
    Testing suite seems to be working with position, not 100% sure
    
    Orientation IK is officially extremely feasiblegit add .git add .
    
    added boolean functionality for euler angles
    
    Testing needs more work but orientation IK is good
    
    Added some featurez. Print points and run tests can be toggled. Still need to fix update bug.
    
    changed the testing suite to be a half sphere
    
    Modified the testing suite to be more realistic
    
    made small syle changes
    
    going to start working on using yaw pitch and roll for testing suite
    
    added conversion from yaw pitch and roll to rotation matrix
    
    conversion from yaw pitch and roll directly to euler angles
    
    created configuration tester. Will run overnight
    
    testing configuration space
    
    Be careful, removed safeties on IK algorithm
    
    valid configs 2
    
    Added time functionality to kinematics_tester
    
    running different tests for the spreadsheet
    
    testing IK with different parameters
    
    Created torque calculator
    
    Added mass dictionary as global variable to mrover_arm
    
    updated json
    
    Code for torques fully implemented, needs testing
    
    pride bot
    
    debugging some torque changes
    
    changed some commenting
    
    Changed CAD files to match new arm, added coloring
    
    Added joint world positions
    
    matched visual model with CAD model
    
    added center of mass xyz
    
    changed configuration test
    
    adding collision avoidance
    
    New stl file from michael, still need to change rotation axes but should be pretty good now
    
    all the rotational axes are correct now
    
    finished inputting collision data
    
    changed json to match end effector position
    
    Added some link functions
    
    changed kinematics
    
    changing collision avoidance system
    
    changed JSON format
    
    completed getting all part transforms for collision avoidance
    
    deez nuts - sid
    
    added safety data
    
    got IK working for new arm, can begin to run orientation tests soon
    
    doing IK tests with new arm
    
    new configuration space
    
    about to merge
    
    added toggle for orientation

    Added logic from ar tag and obstacle to waypoint and obstacle.
    The rover now checks if it can reach the ar tag/waypoint without
    hitting the obstacle. Only if it can't will it avoid the obstacle.
